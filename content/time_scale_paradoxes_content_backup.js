Maybe we're early to the cosmic party‚Äîmost stars suitable for life are just now forming. Or maybe civilizations keep missing each other by millions of years, like cosmic ships passing in an impossibly vast night. Time scales that seem 'plenty' to us might be meaningless on cosmic scales!",
            incorrect_feedback: "While 13.8 billion years seems like plenty of time, cosmic timing might work differently than we imagine. Most habitable planets may be much younger than Earth, or civilizations might operate on time scales so different from ours that contact becomes nearly impossible.

Beings that live for millions of years might consider a thousand-year delay in responding to be 'immediate.' Or they might operate on such vast time scales that coordinating contact requires planning periods longer than our entire species has existed. What seems like poor coordination to us might be precise timing to them!",
