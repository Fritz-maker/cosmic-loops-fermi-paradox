            description: "Hans Moravec proposed a thought experiment where consciousness could be uploaded by gradually replacing neurons with functionally identical artificial components. If consciousness remains continuous during gradual replacement, the final result would be uploaded consciousness without the death-and-copying problem. This process could take place over months or years.",
