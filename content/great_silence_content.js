It had all the characteristics of an artificial signal from space, but despite pointing our best telescopes at that exact spot for decades, we have heard nothing but cosmic silence. Was it a one-time alien transmission? A natural phenomenon we do not understand? The silence afterward is almost more haunting than the signal itself.",

When Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered the first pulsar in 1967, the incredibly regular radio pulses were so precise that researchers half-jokingly called them LGM-1 (Little Green Men 1).
